description: '"Of all the problems which America faces on the land and on the seas,
  no one is so important as that of making regenerates out of degenerates. The massing
  of people in large cities, the incoming of vast multitudes from the impoverished
  masses of several European and Asiatic countries, the tendency to interpret liberty
  as license, the contagious nature of moral, as well as of physical, diseases combine
  to make it of the utmost importance that American enterprise and moral force find
  ways and means for accomplishing this transformation. Whatever contributes to the
  loosening of a problem by throwing light upon the conditions is of value in aiding
  in its solution, hence the publication of this study of the family of Jonathan Edwards
  as a contrast to the fact-based composite called the Jukes family. This book compares
  and contrasts the stark differences in the education, family backgrounds, achievement
  propensities, character, values, socioeconomic levels, and motivations of the members
  of these two families." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).'
